## Potential tasks:

Basic/introductory tasks

1. Work on the CSS to make it look nicer, experiment with flexbox etc.
2. The keyboard only shows natural notes right now, how can we incorporate the sharps/flats that are normally on keyboards
3. Can we control this with our computer keyboard? How do we handle the different octaves?
4. Add more features from the WebAudio API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) e.g. add a waveshaper to allow distortion. Add more complex waveforms.
5. Can we port it to React or another framework?
